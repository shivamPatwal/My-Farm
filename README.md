Motivation for the work

</h3>

Since the past days and in the present too, farmers usually detect the crop diseases with their naked eye which makes them take tough decisions on which fertilizers to use. It requires detailed knowledge the types of diseases and lot of experience needed to make sure the actual disease detection. Some of the diseases look almost similar to farmers often leaves them confused. In case the farmer makes wrong predictions and uses the wrong fertilizers or more than the normal dose (or) threshold or Limit (every plant has some threshold fertilizers spraying to be followed), it will mess up the whole plant (or) soil and cause enough damage to plant and fields.

<p >This Screen offers an instant diagnosis of a diseased plant to the farmer, which help the farmer with the solution to manage the problem instantly and effectively through our app<br>This Screen is created to detect the disease of a crop through its leaf or disease part. In this project concept of <strong>deep learning</strong> is used which uses the concept of neural networks to solve critical tasks like human brain. For the image classification task since we are classifying leaf images based on its disease so to serve that purpose, we have used CNN (Convolution Neural Network) Famous for working with image data since it can detect features automatically in a fast way because even normal images consist of lakhs of features. In this, we have created the model with different layers like CNN, and max pooling. For boosting the model accuracy, we have used pre-trained Alex net Model weights for our CNN layer so training for those layers has been freezed and the rest layers were trained in the training process.   </p>

<p > The user should be able to upload photos of plants to get advice from experts. Experts will review and provide their advice over the app.

The database is built on firebase and consist of two sections users and uploads.

The users section consists of all the details the user enters when he registers, whenever the user clicks the allot button, the crop is also updated in his corresponding key.
