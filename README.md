Motivation for the work

</h3>

Since the past days and in the present too, farmers usually detect the crop diseases with their naked eye which makes them take tough decisions on which fertilizers to use. It requires detailed knowledge the types of diseases and lot of experience needed to make sure the actual disease detection. Some of the diseases look almost similar to farmers often leaves them confused. In case the farmer makes wrong predictions and uses the wrong fertilizers or more than the normal dose (or) threshold or Limit (every plant has some threshold fertilizers spraying to be followed), it will mess up the whole plant (or) soil and cause enough damage to plant and fields.
